<p>So I finally made the blog section</p>
<p>After being recommended a lot of videos on Youtube about indie web and neocities and indie web styled websites, I finally got around to building my own website and so far it's been pretty intuitive. HTML and CSS are pretty easy to get the hang of and i've been having a lot of fun.</p>
<h2>Tech stack</h2>
<p>I spent a while thinking about how to make this website. At first, I thought about using some static site generator like jekyll or zola.</p>
<p>I settled on just plain ass handwritten html and css with a bit of js for some dynamic elements.
A big part of this was to learn some webdev (barfs violently). Be grateful it's not React lmao.</p>
<p>This blog section is also pretty cool. I write these in obsidian in markdown and a python script converts this into a blog post on the website which is pretty awesome.</p>
<h2>The design</h2>
<p>I've made each section of this website feel like a different piece of software/hardware.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Projects</strong> page is inspired by <em>Persona 5</em>, one of my favourite games and probably my favourite part of this website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Links</strong> page is inspired by early Y2K/early web style.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This <strong>Notes</strong> section is supposed to look like audio equipment inspired by <em>Bocchi The Rock</em>. </p>
</li>
</ul>
