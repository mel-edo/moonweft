# 🌙 moonweft

This is my little corner of the internet where i’m slowly building a personal home, collecting notes, projects, media and whatever else I feel like sharing.

> Check out the site [here :D](https://mel-edo.github.io/moonweft/)

### ✧ Pages (WIP)

- Home - introduction, featured work and other cool things
- About - who I am, what I’m learning, things I enjoy
- Projects - tools, experiments, etc.
- Notes - short logs, garden entries, half-formed ideas
- Links - bookmarks, web inspirations, neighbors
- MOTD
- Guestbook - say hi :>
- Media - books, games, music
- Now - currently listening, playing, reading etc.
